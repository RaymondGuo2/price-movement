## **Predicting Daily Stock/Commodity Price Movements Using Multi-Source Data**

### **Objective**
Build a pipeline to predict the next-day price movement (up/down or actual price change) of a set of financial assets (stocks, commodities, ETFs) using historical data, alternative data (news sentiment, social media), and technical indicators.  
You will orchestrate data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using **Airflow**, and experiment with multiple ML models to pick the best one.

## **Components**

### **1. Data Collection**
- **Sources**
  - Historical price data: Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Quandl
  - Macro-economic indicators: interest rates, inflation, FX rates
  - Alternative data: news sentiment (FinBERT/NLP), social media sentiment (Twitter API), Google Trends
- **Airflow role**
  - Schedule daily or hourly data ingestion DAGs
  - Monitor data quality and failures
  - Trigger updates to the feature store

---

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- **Features**
  - Technical indicators: Moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, volatility
  - Sentiment scores combined with price features
  - Time-lag features (past *n* days of returns)
- **Targets**
  - **Classification:** Will the asset price go up/down tomorrow?
  - **Regression:** Predict actual next-day price or return
- **Airflow role**
  - DAG for feature computation
  - Handle missing data, normalization, and feature store updates

---

### **3. Model Training & Selection**
- **Models to try**
  - Classical: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
  - Deep learning: LSTM, GRU (for time series)
  - Ensemble methods
- **Steps**
  - Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV or Optuna)
  - Model selection using validation metrics
- **Airflow role**
  - DAG to retrain models on schedule (e.g., weekly)
  - Trigger model evaluation and logging
  - Store model artifacts in a model registry

---

### **4. Prediction Pipeline**
- **Functionality**
  - Make predictions daily or in real-time
  - Generate alerts/signals for predicted upward or downward movement
- **Airflow role**
  - DAG for batch prediction
  - Integrate with dashboard (e.g., Plotly/Dash or Streamlit)
  - Log predictions and model confidence

---

### **5. Backtesting & Evaluation**
- **Metrics**
  - Accuracy, F1-score (for classification)
  - RMSE/MAE (for regression)
  - Sharpe ratio, cumulative returns (for financial relevance)
- **Airflow role**
  - DAG for backtesting workflow
  - Automated comparison of new models vs baseline

---

## **Further Advanced Extensions**
1. **Reinforcement Learning layer**
   - Use model predictions to simulate trading strategies
   - Evaluate portfolio performance and Sharpe ratio
2. **Feature importance explainability**
   - SHAP values for ML models
   - LIME for time-series models
3. **Cloud integration**
   - Deploy DAGs on Airflow in GCP/AWS
   - Store features in BigQuery or S3, use SageMaker/Vertex AI for ML training
